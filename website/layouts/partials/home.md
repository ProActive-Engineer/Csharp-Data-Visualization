**This website is a collection of minimal-case code examples demonstrating how to visualize data in C#.** Rather than fragment a bunch of graphics-related content across various blog posts I decided to collect them here on a small website dedicated to .NET 2D graphics projects. This content is an extension of the [Csharp Data Visualization project](https://github.com/swharden/Csharp-Data-Visualization) on GitHub.

**Target audience:** Code and discussion on this website is geared toward developers who understand general programming concepts (functions, classes, inheritance, types) but may be new to C# or haven't had much experience using graphics libraries which target the .NET platform. Advanced and nuanced topics are intentionally avoided to make this content more approachable for newcomers.
